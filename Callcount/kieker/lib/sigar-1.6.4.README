The sigar-<version>.jar is the platform-independent Java binding of the Sigar 
library which is required to compile Kieker. At runtime, it is required to 
place an additional platform-specific object file for the operating system and
system architecture, e.g., libsigar-x86-linux.so, which should be downloaded 
from the Sigar web site (http://support.hyperic.com/display/SIGAR/). The 
platform-specific object files for some common architectures on linux and
windows are already included in the Kieker' lib/sigar-native-libs/ directory.
